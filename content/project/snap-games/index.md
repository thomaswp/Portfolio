In my introductory programming class, students make an open-ended project

The outcome was a game-based curriculum, where students build Bounce!, based on a popular casual mobile game ([Okay?](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.stollenmayer.philipp.Pop_1_1_Android)), with 10M+ downloads.

### Introductory Programming

This project is designed to teach programming basics (loops, variables, procedures, conditionals). While the game is complex, students write almost the whole thing, with only a small bit of instructor-written code to get them started and to handle the complex math of bouncing.

Bounce! uses the Snap<em>!</em> block-based programming language that lets students create expressive apps easily. Research suggests that blocks allow students to learn core programming concepts like iteration earlier, before they grapple with syntax.

### Instructions

{{< figure src="snap.png" class="gif" >}}

Bounce! contains 4 labs, teaching Iteration, Variables, Procedures and Conditionals. Each lab is broken up into manageable steps, with:
* Learning objective(s)
* A visual preview of the completed step
* Textual instructions
* Hints
* Pair programming or buddy programming reminders

Advanced students can complete bonus objectives at the end of each lesson.

### Classroom Impact

Bounce has been well-received in my introductory programming course, where it is supported by a [flipped classroom model](../snap-videos/), allowing students to receive hands-on support during class.  It prepares students to create their own open-ended programming project later in the semester.
